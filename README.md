* Author: Garett Skaar

## Overview

This is a simple Deck of Cards program using GO. The program will shuffle
a Deck of Cards and then request a number from the user. This number will 
determine the number of cards dealt from the top of the deck. The cards 
will print out to the screen (Suit and Number).
